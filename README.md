## Player

The [Music Player](packages/player/README.md) is a simple spotify-like app that uses the ElevenLabs API to generate background music. While basic from a UI perspective, this example involves complex state management and replication across windows, a from-scratch component library, and a CI/CD process that involves smoke testing the app on Mac/Windows/Linux to guarantee that it can successfully auto-update.
